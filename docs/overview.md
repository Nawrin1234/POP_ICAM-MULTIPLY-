# Pop to Make: Math Adventure - Overview

## Project Mission
"Pop to Make" is an interactive mental math game designed specifically for children aged 6 to 12. The goal is to transform math practice from a chore into a magical adventure. By combining high-energy arcade gameplay (popping bubbles) with rewarding AI-generated imagery, we incentivize children to improve their arithmetic speed and accuracy.

## Target Audience
- **Age Range**: 6 to 12 years old.
- **Skill Level**: Varies from basic addition (Beginner) to complex multi-step mental math (Math Master).

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. **The Challenge**: A target number is displayed prominently at the top of the screen.
2. **The Action**: Bubbles with different numeric values float across the screen. Players tap/click bubbles to add their values to a "current sum."
3. **The Success**: Reaching the exact target sum pops the target, awards points, and charges the **Magic Meter**.
4. **The Reward**: Once the Magic Meter is 100% full, the child enters the "Creator Forge" where they can use their math energy to summon a high-quality AI image using Gemini.
